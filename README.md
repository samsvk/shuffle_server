## About the Project

> Shuffle is an online streaming analytics tool built with the purpose to prevent generalised algorithms plaguing OUR music. Shuffle became extremely useful in early development when travelling with my Girlfriend - being in total control of what playlists, genres and how many songs were going to be shuffled allowed us to create some great jams and enjoy the rides.

#### Overview:

- `routes` - Contains server routes.
- `routes/controllers` - Auth functions.
- `consts` - Default configuration and consts used throughout.
- `utils` - Encryption/Decryption, shuffle algorithm, encoding functions.


#### Build using this technology:

#### Spotify Web API

## About the Project

> Shuffle is an online streaming analytics tool built with the purpose to prevent generalised algorithms plaguing OUR music. Shuffle became extremely useful in early development when travelling with my Girlfriend - being in total control of what playlists, genres and how many songs were going to be shuffled allowed us to create some great jams and enjoy the rides.
